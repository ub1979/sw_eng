name: context-save
description: Saves working context for session continuity — captures git state, decisions made, remaining work, open questions, and key file paths into .sdlc/context.md so the next session can resume without rebuilding context. Use this skill whenever the user mentions save context, save progress, session end, wrap up, pause work, I'm done for now, save state, checkpoint, context save, or before ending a long session.

# Context Save

Captures the current working context and writes it to `.sdlc/context.md` for seamless session continuity. The next session reads this file to resume exactly where you left off.

---

## When to Use

- End of a work session
- Before switching to a different project
- After completing a major milestone
- When the user says "save progress" or "I'm done for now"
- Automatically suggested by the orchestrator after completing a pipeline phase

---

## Step 1 — Gather Context

Collect all of the following. Use tools — do not guess or rely on memory.

### 1.1 Git State

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log --oneline -5
git stash list
```

Record: current branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, any stashes.

### 1.2 Decisions Made This Session

Scan the conversation for decisions:
- Architecture choices ("we chose X over Y because...")
- Design decisions ("the color palette is...", "we're using pattern X")
- Scope decisions ("we're deferring X", "MVP includes Y but not Z")
- Technical tradeoffs ("using library A instead of B because...")

### 1.3 Work Completed

- Which pipeline phases ran (requirements, architecture, planning, development, etc.)
- Which tasks/stories were completed
- Which files were created or modified
- Test results (pass/fail counts)
- Review verdicts

### 1.4 Remaining Work

- Next task in the plan (by ID if available)
- Blocked items and what unblocks them
- Known bugs or issues found but not yet fixed
- Deferred items with reason

### 1.5 Open Questions

- Unanswered questions from requirements or reviews
- Decisions that need user input
- Ambiguities in the spec

### 1.6 Key File Paths

- All generated documents: requirements.md, plan.md, task-graph.md, project-plan.md
- Source directories
- Test directories
- Config files
- Reports: review-report.md, bug-report.md, security-report.md

---

## Step 2 — Write .sdlc/context.md

```bash
mkdir -p .sdlc
```

Write to `.sdlc/context.md`:

```markdown
# Session Context

> Saved: [date and time]
> Branch: [current branch]
> Project: [project name from plan.md or directory name]

## Git State

- Branch: `[branch]`
- Uncommitted changes: [list or "none"]
- Recent commits:
  - [hash] [message]
  - [hash] [message]
- Stashes: [list or "none"]

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| [what was decided] | [why] | [when] |

## Work Completed

### Pipeline Phases
- [x] Requirements — requirements.md
- [x] Architecture — plan.md
- [ ] Planning — task-graph.md (not started)
- ...

### Tasks Completed
| Task | Status | Files | Evidence |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| T-001: [title] | Done | [files] | Tests pass |

## Remaining Work

### Next Up
- [ ] T-XXX: [title] — [brief description]

### Blocked
- [ ] T-XXX: [title] — blocked by [reason]

### Deferred
- [ ] [item] — deferred because [reason]

## Open Questions

1. [question] — needs input from [who]

## Key Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| requirements.md | Requirements | Complete |
| plan.md | Architecture | Complete |
| task-graph.md | Task breakdown | In progress |
| src/ | Source code | [X files] |
| tests/ | Tests | [X passing] |

## Resume Instructions

To continue this work:
1. Read this file first
2. Then read: [list of key docs to read]
3. Start with: [specific next action]
```

---

## Step 3 — Idempotency

If `.sdlc/context.md` already exists:
1. Read the existing file
2. Preserve the "Decisions Made" table — append new decisions, don't overwrite
3. Update all other sections with current state
4. Add a "Previous Sessions" section at the bottom with a one-line summary of each prior save

---

## Step 4 — Confirm

After writing, present a one-line summary:

> "Context saved to `.sdlc/context.md`. Resume next session by reading that file. [X] decisions recorded, [Y] tasks remaining, next up: [task]."

---

## Quality Standards

- Every field must be filled with real data from tools, not placeholders
- Git state must come from actual `git` commands, not memory
- File paths must be verified to exist
- Task IDs must match the plan if one exists
- The "Resume Instructions" section must be specific enough that a fresh agent can pick up the work without asking questions
