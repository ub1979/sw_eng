name: learn
description: Records and retrieves cross-session learnings — patterns, pitfalls, decisions, and conventions discovered during development. Appends to .sdlc/learnings.jsonl so future sessions can search for relevant lessons before repeating mistakes. Use this skill whenever the user mentions learn, record this, remember this pattern, don't forget, pitfall, lesson learned, note this convention, or when a debugging session reveals a non-obvious root cause.

# Learn — Cross-Session Knowledge

Maintains a searchable JSONL file of learnings that compound across sessions. Each entry captures a pattern, pitfall, decision, or convention with enough context to be useful months later.

---

## Recording a Learning

### Step 1 — Classify

Determine the category:

| Category | When to Use | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `pattern` | A reusable approach that worked well | "Use Zod schemas at API boundary for runtime validation" |
| `pitfall` | Something that caused a bug or wasted time | "Next.js App Router doesn't support `req.body` in route handlers without explicit parsing" |
| `decision` | A deliberate choice with rationale | "Chose Drizzle over Prisma for this project because of edge runtime support" |
| `convention` | A project-specific standard | "All API responses use `{ data, error, meta }` envelope" |

### Step 2 — Write the Entry

Append one JSON line to `.sdlc/learnings.jsonl`:

```bash
mkdir -p .sdlc
```

```json
{
  "date": "2026-06-21",
  "project": "project-name",
  "category": "pitfall",
  "summary": "One-line description searchable by keyword",
  "detail": "Full explanation with context — what happened, why, and what to do differently",
  "files": ["src/api/route.ts", "src/middleware/auth.ts"],
  "tags": ["nextjs", "api", "parsing"]
}
```

**Rules:**
- `summary` must be searchable — include the technology, the symptom, and the fix in one line
- `detail` must be self-contained — a reader with no context should understand the lesson
- `files` lists the files where this learning applies (empty array if general)
- `tags` are lowercase keywords for search
- One learning per entry — don't bundle unrelated lessons

### Step 3 — Confirm

After appending:

> "Learned: [summary]. Stored in `.sdlc/learnings.jsonl` ([N] total entries)."

## Retrieving Learnings

### On Session Start

When beginning work on a project, search for relevant learnings:

```bash
# Search by project name
grep -i "project-name" .sdlc/learnings.jsonl 2>/dev/null

# Search by technology
grep -i "nextjs\|react\|fastapi" .sdlc/learnings.jsonl 2>/dev/null

# Search by category
grep '"pitfall"' .sdlc/learnings.jsonl 2>/dev/null

# Search by file path
grep "src/api" .sdlc/learnings.jsonl 2>/dev/null
```

Present relevant findings:

> "Found [N] relevant learnings for this project:
> - [pitfall] [summary] ([date])
> - [pattern] [summary] ([date])"

### On Debugging

Before hypothesizing, check if this bug pattern has been seen before:

```bash
grep -i "keyword-from-error" .sdlc/learnings.jsonl 2>/dev/null
```

If a matching pitfall exists, apply it before trying other hypotheses.

## Auto-Learn Triggers

The orchestrator (idk_it) should call this skill automatically when:

1. **A debugging session resolves** — record the root cause as a pitfall
2. **A code review finds a recurring pattern** — record it as a convention
3. **An architectural decision is made** — record the rationale as a decision
4. **A workaround is applied** — record it as a pitfall with the workaround

---

## Quality Standards

- Never record obvious things ("use git for version control")
- Every entry must be specific enough to be actionable
- Pitfalls must include both the symptom AND the fix
- Decisions must include the alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- Don't duplicate — search before recording. If a similar entry exists, update it instead
