description: Performance benchmarking — measures Core Web Vitals, API response times, bundle size, and build time. Compares against previous benchmarks to detect regressions. Use this skill whenever the user mentions benchmark, performance test, how fast is it, page speed, core web vitals, lighthouse, bundle size, load time, latency, throughput, performance regression, or wants to measure and track application performance.

# Performance Benchmark

Measures application performance across multiple dimensions and compares against previous benchmarks to detect regressions. Produces `.sdlc/benchmark-report.md`.

---

## ⛔ ENFORCEMENT: EVERY METRIC MUST COME FROM TOOL OUTPUT

> Do not estimate performance. Run the measurement tool, read the number, record it.
> "Should be fast" is not a benchmark. "`lighthouse --output json` reports LCP: 1.2s" is a benchmark.

---

## Step 1 — Detect Application Type

```bash
ls package.json requirements.txt go.mod 2>/dev/null
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"(next|react|vue|svelte|express|fastify)"'
ls src/app src/pages public index.html 2>/dev/null
```

Determine which benchmarks apply:

| App Type | Benchmarks |
|----------|-----------|
| Web App (SSR/SPA) | Core Web Vitals + Bundle Size + Build Time + API Latency |
| API Service | API Latency + Throughput + Build Time |
| CLI Tool | Execution Time + Build Time |
| Library | Build Time + Bundle Size |

---

## Step 2 — Load Previous Benchmark

```bash
cat .sdlc/benchmark-report.md 2>/dev/null
```

If a previous benchmark exists, extract all metric values for comparison. If none exists, this is a baseline run.

---

## Step 3 — Run Benchmarks

### 3.1 Build Performance

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf dist/ build/ .next/ node_modules/.cache/ 2>/dev/null

# Timed build
time npm run build 2>&1

# Bundle analysis (if web app)
du -sh dist/ build/ .next/ 2>/dev/null
npx source-map-explorer dist/**/*.js --json 2>/dev/null | jq '.results[0].totalBytes'
# or: npx next-bundle-analyzer 2>/dev/null
```

Record: build time (seconds), output size (bytes), largest chunk.

### 3.2 Core Web Vitals (Web Apps Only)

**Requires the app to be running.** Start it first:

```bash
npm run build && npm start &
sleep 5
```

**Option A: Lighthouse CLI (preferred)**
```bash
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --output json --chrome-flags="--headless --no-sandbox" 2>/dev/null
# Extract metrics:
# LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) — target: <2.5s
# FID/INP (Interaction to Next Paint) — target: <200ms
# CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) — target: <0.1
# FCP (First Contentful Paint) — target: <1.8s
# TTI (Time to Interactive) — target: <3.8s
# TBT (Total Blocking Time) — target: <200ms
# Performance Score — target: >90
```

**Option B: Playwright Performance (fallback)**
```bash
npx playwright test --config=perf.config.ts 2>/dev/null
# or manually:
# Navigate to page, measure load timing via Performance API
```

Record all available metrics.

### 3.3 API Response Times

```bash
# Install k6 or use curl timing
# k6 (preferred for load testing)
cat > /tmp/bench-api.js <<'EOF'
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';
export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '30s',
  thresholds: { http_req_duration: ['p(95)<200'] },
};
export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://localhost:3000/api/health');
  check(res, { 'status 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
}
EOF
k6 run /tmp/bench-api.js 2>/dev/null

# Fallback: curl timing (3 runs, report median)
for i in 1 2 3; do
  curl -o /dev/null -s -w '%{time_total}\n' http://localhost:3000/api/health
done
```

Record: p50, p95, p99 latency, throughput (req/s), error rate.

### 3.4 Startup Time

```bash
# Measure cold start
time (npm start &
  until curl -sf http://localhost:3000/health > /dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 0.1; done
  echo "Ready")
kill %1 2>/dev/null
```

Record: seconds from process start to first healthy response.

### 3.5 Memory & Resource Usage

```bash
# Start app, measure memory after stabilization
npm start &
APP_PID=$!
sleep 10
ps -o rss= -p $APP_PID | awk '{print $1/1024 "MB"}'
kill $APP_PID 2>/dev/null
```

Record: RSS memory in MB after 10s of idle.

## Step 4 — Compare & Flag Regressions

For each metric, compare against the previous benchmark:

| Delta | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Improved >10% | IMPROVED | Note in report |
| Within 10% | STABLE | No action |
| Degraded 10-25% | WARNING | Flag in report |
| Degraded >25% | REGRESSION | Flag as failure, recommend investigation |

---

## Step 5 — Write .sdlc/benchmark-report.md

```bash
mkdir -p .sdlc
```

```markdown
